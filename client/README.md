# Pokelab.xyz

## Presentation
Pokelab is a website gathering various datas about the Pok√©mon universe, hosted at [pokelab.xyz](https://www.pokelab.xyz/).
The website is made with Typescript / React, and using the framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-side rendering.
Pokelab is my first full-stack project. This repository is the front-end, you can find the back-end [here](https://github.com/grr14/PokelabServer).

## Todo
Non-exhaustive list of features I will work on:
- user authentification feature
- improve advanced search on the /pokemons page
- improve performance by adding infinite scroll feature on the Pokemon Cards
- reduce loading time
- adding informations for the most recent released Pokemon games (Generation VIII)

## How to Setup
Start by cloning this repository, as well the [back-end repository](https://github.com/grr14/PokelabServer). Start the server with ```npm start```, and the client with ```yarn dev```. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
